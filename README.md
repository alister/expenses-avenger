# Write a simple expenses tracker web application

## Introduction

Test project for the final step of TopTal interview process.

### front-end

Angular

### Symfony v2.6.6 - backed API.

2.6.6 is the latest stable version of Symfony.

## Requirements

* The user must be able to create an account and log in.
* When logged in, user can see, edit and delete expenses he entered.
* When entered, each expense has: date, time, description, amount, comment
* User can filter expenses.
* User can print expenses per week with total amount and average day spending.
* Minimal UI/UX design is needed.
* I need every client operation done using JavaScript, reloading the page is not an option.
* REST API. Make it possible to perform all user actions via the API, including authentication (If a mobile application and you donâ€™t know how to create your own backend you can use Parse.com, Firebase.com or similar services to create the API).
* You need to be able to pass credentials to both the webpage and the API.
* In any case you should be able to explain how a REST API works and demonstrate that by creating functional tests that use the REST Layer directly.
* Bonus: unit tests!
* You will not be marked on graphic design, however, do try to keep it as tidy as possible.
